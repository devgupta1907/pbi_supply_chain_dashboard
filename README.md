## Supply Chain Dashboard For FMCG Domain

I am pleased to announce the successful completion of another Power BI Dashboard Project. The primary objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive dashboard for AtliQ Mart, a hypothetical company, to streamline their supply chain and identify areas for improvement. This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of various key performance indicators (KPIs) such as On Time Delivery % (OTD %), In Full Delivery % (IFD %), and other metrics, enabling AtliQ Mart to make data-driven decisions and optimize their business processes. Thanks to @codebasicshub for this project.


Dashboard Snapshots, PDF version and PBIX file is available in this repository. Feel free to download it, and add your visualizations to it. Don't forget to share it with me.
